This is my (Chris Forsythe's) work for HW1, clipped lines. I wrote it in Java and tested it on my personal laptop with Eclipse Java Oxygen.
I then moved the program to tux to test on that server as well as prepare the makefile.

The only file containing code for this assignment is "main.java".

To compile/run the program, you must run "make" which will create an executable .jar flle, which can be run from the command line.

You may also use "make clean" to remove the compiled class file after this.

To run with arguments you must format the run command as below:
make run ARGS="<arguments>"

I should mention that the transformations work for the most part however certain transformations may cause some less than ideal line drawings or a couple lines to not
appear, I do plan to fix this before the next assignment.
