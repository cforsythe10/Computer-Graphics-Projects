These are all assignments, including extra credit for Drexel University's Computer Graphics class

Assignments one and two aren't too strong but I am very proud of assignments 4, 5, and the Extra
Credit assignment. They don't work perfectly but were written from scratch and VERY difficult

All of these are with a makefile that can be run with make. This will create an executable .rar
file that will run with ./<Assignment name i.e. CG_hw4> <arguments> with the arguments being
various transformations. What controls what is shown towards the top of each java file. Example
transformations include sheer transtormations, rotations, world window and viewport transformations,
x, y, and z movement, etc. Each project can have the input file changed with the argument "-f"

Assignments 4 and 5 will theoretically work with any 3d mesh
