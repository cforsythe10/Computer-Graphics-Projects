This project was developed in Java using Eclipse on a machine running Windows 10. All other preparation (makefile and script) was done with a remote connection to tux.

To run the program from commandline, run "make" and then "./CG_hwEC <arguments>"

This program accepts the moveto, curveto, and Line in the simplified postscript format, sent to the program from a file specified at command line.

This project accepts all specified command line arguments and all translations/mapping work well.

The line drawing algorithm seems to be struggling with parts of certain curves causing it to not draw the curves completely correctly, though it is fairly close.
