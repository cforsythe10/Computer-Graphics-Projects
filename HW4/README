I spent the weekend refactoring almost all of my code, this time as far as I'm aware everything works very well. The program has parallel and perspective projection and 
backface culling implemented with all specified command line arguments working as intended. The program only parses smf files as nearly all old code has been removed. 
I used Java to wite this on a Windows machine, sent everything to tux, and wrote all other code to compile/run the program there.

The code compiles with javac, just run make on the command line to get an executable jar file, then run ./CG_hw4 <args> > {filename}. The script will execute the jar and
it will generate a file with the name specified. The file containing main is CG_hw4.java.
